The Group's diverse businesses include port management, electric power generation and transmission, renewable energy, mining, airport operations, natural gas, food processing and infrastructure.[3] In April 2021, Adani Group crossed US$100 billion in market capitalization, and in April 2022 it crossed the $200 billion mark, in both cases becoming the third Indian conglomerate to do so, after Tata Group and Reliance Industries.[4][5] In November 2022, it reached $280 billion (INR 24 trillion) surpassing Tata Group.[6] Adani subsequently lost more than $104 billion of market capitalization after fraud and market manipulation allegations by short-seller firm Hindenburg Research. The Adani Group has also attracted other controversies due to various reports of irregular practices.[7][8][9] More than 60 percent of the Adani Group revenue is derived from coal-related businesses.[10] The company's corporate debt totaled $30 billion in 2022.\",\n",
